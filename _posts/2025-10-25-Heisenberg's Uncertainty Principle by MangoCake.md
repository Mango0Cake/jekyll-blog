Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Explained Simply 10.25.25


By using common sense, we would often imagine science as something that if we just build better tools, one could measure anything exactly. But in the world of Quantum Physics, that is definitely not true. One of the most mind boggling rules of nature (that violates the claim previously stated) is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

So, what does it state?

--> "The more precisely you know where a particle is, the less you can know how fast it is moving (and vise versa)."

Imagine a firefly flying around in a dark room. You want to know where it is, so you shine a flashlight to it.

Two things could happen:

1. If the flashlight is really bright, you can see the firefly pretty well, but the light knocks it around, changing the way it flies.

2. If the flashlight is dim, you don't disturb it too much, but now, it is hard to tell where it is.


Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle forever changed the foundations of physcs, showing that the universe we live in isn't the normal system previously imagineed, but operates on an inherent level of chance and probability.
